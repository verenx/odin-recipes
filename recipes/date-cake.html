    <h1>Delicious Cake with Dates, Banana, Almonds and without sugar</h1>

    <h2>Gluten-free delicacy</h2>
    <p>Healthy and sugar-free baking is trendy, no question about it. This <strong>date chocolate banana cake</strong> is currently one of our favorites in the bakery. Chocolate meets fruit, more specifically dates and bananas. The combination of real, unsweetened, cocoa powder and the sweetness of fruit makes the cake a fluffy dessert that is not only healthy but also tastes great. Since the cake is made without flour, it is also gluten-free. Instead of flour, we use ground nuts, which give the cake a great and "fudgy" texture.</p>
