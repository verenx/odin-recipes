    <h2>Italy on our plate</h2>
    <p>We can only repeat it: We love Italy with its Mediterranean cuisine, loads of pizza, pasta, burrata and many other delicious ingredients. No visit to Italy is complete without good olive oil, spaghetti and basil. We particularly like to cook Italian food in the summer when we can't afford a holiday in the south. We serve: burrata on tagliatelle with dried tomatoes - buonissimo!</p>
