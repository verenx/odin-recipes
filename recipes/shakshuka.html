    <h2>Arabic breakfast delight</h2>
    <p>Ever heard of Shakshuka? A spicy breakfast dish that is a speciality in North African and Arabic cuisine. Translated from Arabic, "Shakshuka" means something like "mixture". The dish is made from poached eggs in a sauce made from tomatoes, chili peppers and onions. And we add an autumnal aroma with pumpkin, feta and spinach. Our pumpkin Shakshuka is then served as an uncomplicated, quick breakfast idea straight from the oven.</p>
